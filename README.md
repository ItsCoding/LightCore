# LightCore
Real-time LED strip music visualization using Python and the ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi.
### Special thanks to ‚ù§
- Scott Lawson for the base [project](https://github.com/scottlawsonbc/audio-reactive-led-strip)
- shunfu for the beat detection [project](https://github.com/shunfu/python-beat-detector)

## Components

The LightCore is mad up of 5 modules:

- `/arduino` - The Arduino code for the ESP32, needed to control the LED strip
- `/light-client` - Webclient to controll the render pipeline and make changes on stage
- `/light-designer` - Electron based GUI to design a stage and position the strips, bascily pepare everything
- `/messageBroker` - Websocket Server that handles *most* of the communication between the modules
- `/midi-adapter` - Midi Adapter to easly integrate existing software/hardware with LightCore
- `/python` - Render pipeline for calculating the LED colors

# Installing dependencies
The pip package manager can also be used to install the python dependencies.
```
pip install numpy
pip install pyaudio
pip install matplotlib
pip install zmq
pip install websocket-client

```
If `pip` is not found try using `python -m pip install` instead.

### Installing macOS dependencies
On macOS, python3 is required and `portaudio` must be used in place of `pyaudio`.
If you don't have brew installed you can get it here: https://brew.sh

```
export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include
brew install portaudio
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pyaudio
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install zmq
pip3 install websocket-client

```

Running the visualization can be done using the command below.

`python3 pipeline.py`

## Installing the Python dependencies
Install python dependencies using apt-get
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pyaudio
```

## Audio device configuration
For the Raspberry Pi, a USB audio device needs to be configured as the default audio device.

Create/edit `/etc/asound.conf`
```
sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
```
Set the file to the following text
```
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
```

Next, set the USB device to as the default device by editing `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`
```
sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
```
Change
```
defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
```
To
```
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
```

## Running this project

#### Install MessageBroker 
```
cd messageBroker 
yarn 
```

#### Install Virtualization, this is only needed if you set your DEVICE to "virtual" or "espv"
```
cd light-designer
yarn 
```

#### Install the WebClient
```
cd light-client
yarn 
```

### Run everything
```
cd startup-controller
yarn && yarn start
```

## Technical Specs

### Network Protocol

To have an nearly unlimited amount of Pixels we can control on one ESP, we needed to change the Protocol a little bit. It now looks like this:

```
<4Bytes Long>Epoch Timestamp
-> For each Pixel
    <1Byte>Address offset
    <1Byte>Address
    <3Bytes>RGB
```

The real Pixeladdress is calculated by `i + 255 * [OFFSET]`

### Use an LogicLevel Shifter
I realised this is a crucial part to have an reliable data stream.

### Pinning

On the ESP32 i use D4 as my data pin. This pin is directly wired to the low input of the LogicLevelShifter. It should step the data signal up to 5v.
There are fore sure different ways out there to wire/build this, but since im not so much into Hardware im fine with this way :D
