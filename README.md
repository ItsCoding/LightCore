## Python Dependencies
Visualization code is compatible with Python 3.9. A few Python dependencies must also be installed:
- Numpy
- Scipy (for digital signal processing)
- PyQtGraph (for GUI visualization)
- PyAudio (for recording audio with microphone)
# Installing dependencies
The pip package manager can also be used to install the python dependencies.
```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install pyqtgraph
pip install pyaudio
```
If `pip` is not found try using `python -m pip install` instead.

### Installing macOS dependencies
On macOS, python3 is required and `portaudio` must be used in place of `pyaudio`.
If you don't have brew installed you can get it here: https://brew.sh

```
export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include
brew install portaudio
brew install pyqt5
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install pyqtgraph
pip3 install pyaudio
```

Running the visualization can be done using the command below.

`python3 visualization.py /tmp`

# Installation for Raspberry Pi
If you encounter any problems running the visualization on a Raspberry Pi, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/scottlawsonbc/audio-reactive-led-strip/issues). Also, please consider opening an issue if you have any questions or suggestions for improving the installation process.

Download and extract all of the files in this repository onto your pi to begin.

## Installing the Python dependencies
Install python dependencies using apt-get
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pyaudio
```

## Audio device configuration
For the Raspberry Pi, a USB audio device needs to be configured as the default audio device.

Create/edit `/etc/asound.conf`
```
sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
```
Set the file to the following text
```
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
```

Next, set the USB device to as the default device by editing `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`
```
sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
```
Change
```
defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
```
To
```
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
```

## Test the LED strip
1. cd rpi_ws281x/python/examples
2. sudo nano strandtest.py
3. Configure the options at the top of the file. Enable logic inverting if you are using an inverting logic-level converter. Set the correct GPIO pin and number of pixels for the LED strip. You will likely need a logic-level converter to convert the Raspberry Pi's 3.3V logic to the 5V logic used by the ws2812b LED strip.
4. Run example with 'sudo python strandtest.py'
